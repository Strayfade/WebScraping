# WebScraping
WebScraping NodeJS Application for all your web-scraping needs! 

### Usage
Download and extract .zip code, then I prefer to open with VS Code.


Change variable "startSearch" to the text (HTML Source) JUST BEFORE the information you wish to scrape.
Change variable "endSearch" to the text (again, HTML) RIGHT AFTER the information you wish to scrape.
The longer the search variables are, the more accurate the search will be.

Change varable "url" to the URL of whatever website you wish to scrape.
